Body      so, last bug report on bishop said that fighting it crashes the game but now that I've nen value around bishop's value, i win some and i "crash"some. Also, fighting rooks, all ofwhich are over 80k while i'm 65k causes crashes in between fights at random moments. I've crashed the game fighting rooks for lik over 10 times and i can't pinpoint what triggers it. I believe it must be because of the fight dragging for too long. Also, if i start using blast, dowzingchain, kick, burninghands etc.. the game crashe

Text      death by stamina loss not giving nen~
Body      I was fighting a pit monster(who had 6 times my strength)
and the fight lasted so long he lost his stamina and ended up collapsed on the ground
gossip I decided to aura blast him killing him, got no nen(experience)
I tried again when he came back, and I tried to strangle him, but nothing.
Is it possible to still gain nen atleast from a monster you beat in unconventional ways( I got him down to 30% health before he collapsed.
