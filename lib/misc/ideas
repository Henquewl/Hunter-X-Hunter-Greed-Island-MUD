Text      Beds~
Body      I think it might be a good idea to put in hotels or something, where if you pay you get to use a bed the restores movement/hp/mana a lot faster perhaps

Somthing like in DBZ when they are almost killed and they go into the stasis pods to rejuvenate quickly would be nice. Maybe you pay someone and they put you in the chamber so you can quickly regain movement and mana

Text      Utilize Gyo to activate other abilities~
Body      Constantly have to use detectenfold, and detectconceal, and infravision, is starting to be a bit of a pain
I recommend having a new ability, named Gyo.
When you use Gyo you activate these other abilities.
that would mean that detection would become a passive ability
an example would be if I used Gyo and I only have detect enfold and detect conceal
gossip so because my detect conceal is on a low skill level. Both abilities activate but only enfold succeeds, while conceal fails
I would still get better at using conceal, but this way gyo doing everything would help people enjoy the game a bit more by worrying less
about activating everything and just say gyo
