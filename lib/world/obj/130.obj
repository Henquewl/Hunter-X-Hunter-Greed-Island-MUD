crown eagle eyes~
   The sharp eyes that served this eagle so well, until the fateful day that a
hunter caught the eagle, now adorn this crown.  Where it not completely
immpossible you would think the eyes follow you around, as you move about the
room.  The eyes sit atop a simple crown of a metal that looks like gold and yet
is almost as hard as steel.

mist swirling~
   The mists swirl and eddy before your eyes, obscuring your vision.  However,
they also look almost thick enough to walk in to.  It almost has enough texture
to be able to touch and feel it.  This mist is different than the others
somehow.

mist whip tendril~
   Reality faded from the mists leaving a single tendril of itself in a solid
form.  The lack of stability of the mists is offset by the firmness of this
wisp.  A strong odor, almost that of old death, comes off the wisp, tearing your
nostrils, causing your eyes and sinuses to water.

mist swirling swirl~
   This stray tendril of a mist seems to come from nowhere just as it seems to
lead nowhere.  But looks can be deceiving.  Something about the mist beckons and
draws you toward it.  Draws you in to it.  Something about it compels you to
enter the mist and prove your worth and defend your right to remain sane.
