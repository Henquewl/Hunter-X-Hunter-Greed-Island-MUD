@G   Greed Island @yis a fictional video game in Hunter x Hunter. It is played on the "Joystation", 
a video game console, is out of print, and sells at auctions for at least 8 billion Jenny.
The game transports its players' physical bodies into the world of Greed Island, only releasing
them when they die (at which point they die in "real life" too), when they win, or when they
use a special card in the game that lets them out. It can only be played by people who can use
Nen. In actuality, it is a real place, an island located east of the Yorbian continent.

   Greed Island was first released in the World of Hunter  Hunter in 1987, created by Ging
Freecss and his associates. It was produced and sold by Marilyn Inc.
According to the Hunters' Tavern website, the difficulty level to get the game used be@n

sheer high price it's been raised to G-class (easy).

@y   In @Gapril 2016@y this Mud project was started by Henque, the objective is reproduce the same
experience of the manga/anime. Make people do their own Hunter character, with a specified
aura type and use spell cards, fight monsters and confront players to beat the game.

   It is a competitive RPG card game, unfortunately the "social" part of was sacrificed for
give most real feeling of living in an real Greed Island. Enjoy.
